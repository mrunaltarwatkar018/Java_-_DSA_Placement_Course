# What is a proramming language?
To communicate with a person, we need a specific language, similarly to communicate with computers, 
programmers also need a language which is called Programming language.

It is a set of instructions written in any specific language.


# A. Machine Language
1. Machine language is a type of low-level programming language.
2. It is a series of 0s and 1s.
3. Needs no translation.
4. It is the language of the computer.


# B. Assembly Language
1. It is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors.
2. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. 
3. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.
4. It is a symbolic language that uses mnemonics to represent the machine language instructions.
5. It is a human-readable form of machine language.
6. It is a low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors.


# C. High level Language
1. It is a developer friendly language.
2. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language.
3. It is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write.


# Some More Types:
1. Procedural Language: It is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read
and write. It is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write
2. Object-Oriented Language: It is a programming language that is designed to be easy to
read and write. It is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to read and
write.
3. Functional Language: It is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write
It is a high-level programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write.


# A Procedural Proramming Language
1. List of instructions to tell the computer, what to do step by step.
2. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions.
3. It is also called structured programming.
4. Examples are FORTRAN AND C.


# B. Functional Programming Language
1. It is an approach to problem solving.
2. It treats every computation as a mathematical function.
3. It allows you to write a mathematical function, i.e. a function 
that takes n arguments and returns a value.
If the program is executed, this function is logically evaluated as needed.
4. Examples are Python, Haskel


# C. Object Oriented Programming Language
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. 
2. In this language, programs are divided into small parts called objects.
3. It uses an object-oriented programming technique that binds related data and functions 
into an object and encourages reuse of these objects within the same and other programs.
4. Example is JAVA


# D. Scripting Language
1. scripting language is a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret 
and execute one command at a time. 
2. In general, scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code in 
than more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++.


# E. Statically Typed Language
1. Performs type checking at the time of compilation
2. Declaration of data type is compulsion


# F. Dynamically Typed Language
1. Performs type checking at Run time.
2. No need to declare data types.



# Memory Management 
In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. 
Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.


# Stack Memory vs Heap Memory:
1. Varaibles are stored in stack memory.
2. Objects are stored in Heaps.
