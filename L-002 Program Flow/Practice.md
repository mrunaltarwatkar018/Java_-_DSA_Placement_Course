# 1. Design a flowchart to write table of any number given by user ( 10 multiples ).
1. Initialize input from user.
2. Initialize times = 1
3. if times <= 10
4.   print(input * 10 )
5.   times = times + 1
6.   Repeat step 3, 4, 5 until condition is true


# 2. Write an Algorithm to find largest number among three given numbers ( take user input)

1. Take three variables as input.
2. Compare first two variables and store it as max.
3. Compare max with third value and store result as max.


# 3. Write pseudocode for both the above scenarios.

1. Initialize input1, input2, input3 from user.
2. Initialize max = 2
3. if input1 > input2
4.     max = input1
5. else max = input2
6. if input3 > max
7.     max = input3
8. print (max)
